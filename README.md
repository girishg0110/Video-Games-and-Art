Educational materials for a Rutgers Google DSC youth program on Video Games and Art intended for middle-schoolers. The languages used in the program were Python (using pyGame) and Java (using Applets -> JavaFX).

<h3>Games</h3>
- Java 3D TicTacToe - A simple introduction to turning code into pictures. If-else logic and display of simple shapes to the screen are explored.
- PyPong + Java Pong - Students are challenged to grapple with continuous, dynamic on-screen updates. We start off building the basic mechanics of the game, and then move on to features of convenience and/or style (i.e. a pause screen, color palette shifting, etc.)
- PyGalaxo - A reimagining of the arcade classic Galaxy Invaders, with minimalist polygonal rocket ships. Introduces arrays and pseudorandom number generation and provokes thought about computationally efficient rendering/memory management. Shoot to win!

<h3>Art</h3>
- PyPaint - An MSPaint-like application with basic drawing functionality. Advanced students are encouraged to invent and implement their own product features (with instructor help), like saving compositions, changing brush thickness/texture, etc.
